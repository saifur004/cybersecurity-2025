Booking System – Phase 1 Test Report
1. Scope

The purpose of this report is to document the penetration testing and functionality testing performed on the registration page of the Booking System application.
All tests were done locally using the provided test environment.

2. Tools Used

Firefox (ZAP built-in browser)

OWASP ZAP

Browser’s developer tools

Manual input testing

3. Methodology

I performed both manual and automated testing:

Manual tests on the registration page by submitting different types of inputs

Observed how the application responded to weak, invalid, or malicious data

Used OWASP ZAP to capture requests and run automated scans

Reviewed alerts generated by ZAP for missing headers and vulnerabilities

4. Manual Testing Results
Test 1 – Weak Password and Invalid Birthdate Accepted

I used a normal email, a password with only a few characters, and selected a future birthdate.
The registration succeeded without any warnings.

Expected:
The system should block weak passwords and future birthdates.

Result:
Registration was accepted.

Test 2 – Invalid Email Format

I entered “abc” as the email and clicked Register.
The browser showed a built-in message: “Please enter an email address”.

Expected:
Backend should validate emails, not only the browser.

Result:
Only browser HTML validation is applied.

Test 3 – Weak Password

I tested with a short password like “123”.
The system accepted it without any warning.

Expected:
The system should require stronger passwords.

Result:
No password validation.

Test 4 – XSS Attempt

I entered <script>alert(1)</script> into the email field.

Expected:
The server should sanitize or reject script tags.

Result:
The browser blocked it only because it wasn’t a valid email format. The server provides no sanitization.

Test 5 – SQL Injection Attempt

Since email requires email format, I placed the payload ' OR 1=1 -- in the password field.

Expected:
The system should detect and reject SQL injection patterns.

Result:
The form accepted the input and continued normally. No validation or sanitization was performed.

5. Automated Testing Results (ZAP)

OWASP ZAP detected the following security issues:

Content Security Policy header not set

Missing anti-clickjacking header

X-Content-Type-Options header missing

These issues weaken the application’s protection against XSS, framing attacks, and MIME-type confusion.

6. Recommendations

Add server-side email validation

Enforce password strength rules

Validate and sanitize all inputs on the backend

Implement CSRF tokens

Add security headers (CSP, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options)

Reject future birthdates and empty fields

Do not rely only on browser validation

7. Conclusion

The registration page contains multiple security and validation weaknesses.
Most validation relies only on the browser, and dangerous inputs like SQL-style strings are accepted without filtering.
The system needs stronger server-side validation and standard security protections.
